# Bun, HTMX, and Fireproof

This is a simple proof-of-concept to get you started using Fireproof on the server side. In this example, we import Fireproof from the node build:

```ts
import { fireproof } from '@fireproof/core/node'
```

This ensures we get the filesystem and node-crypto APIs, instead of the browser versions.

## Notes

* In a production deployment you'd want to link your edge Fireproof instances (the ones in your Bun server) to each other, most likely using something like PartyKit (CloudFlare durable objects) or IPFS. More info on [connecting Fireproof instances can be found here](https://use-fireproof.com/docs/connect/).
* Read the Hono docs to learn [about deploying this app to edge functions](https://hono.dev).

## hyperwave ðŸŒŠ

https://hyperwave.codes/

hyperwave is a server-side framework for building web applications.

- fast: Bun and Hono for best-in-class performance
- lightweight: ~20kb payload. Demo loads in a couple seconds even while throttled to 2G.
- productive: use the best tools for the job: Tailwind, HTMX, and TypeScript
- portable: compile a binary to deploy anywhere

### Setup

`bun install && bun dev`

Visit port 3000 and edit `server.tsx`

---

### Example

This is the endpoint serving our initial landing page:

```typescript
app.get('/', ({ html }) =>
  html(
    <Layout title="hyperwave">
      <section class="flex flex-col gap-8">
        <div>
          <button
            class="bg-blue-100 p-4 text-sm font-bold rounded-md shadow-sm"
            hx-get="/instructions"
            hx-target="closest div"
          >
            fetch instructions from <code>/instructions</code>
          </button>
        </div>
      </section>
    </Layout>
  )
)
```

- The API serves a full HTML document to the client, which includes Tailwind classes and HTMX attributes
- The response is wrapped in a `<Layout />` tag, a server-rendered functional component, which takes a `title` prop
- The button, when clicked, will issue a `GET` request to `/instructions` and replace the content of its parent div with the response.

### Deployment

Build an executable for your current architecture with `bun run build`

`PORT` environment variable is available if needed (default 3000)

Note: deploy `public/` with the executable, it contains the generated UnoCSS build.

---

### Components

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) provides the bundler, runtime, test runner, and package manager.
- [SQLite](https://bun.sh/docs/api/sqlite) is production-ready and built into Bun.
- [Hono](https://hono.dev) is a robust web framework with great DX and performance
- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/integrations/cli) is Tailwind-compatible and generates only the styles used in application code.
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/reference/) gives 99% of the client-side interactivity most apps need.
